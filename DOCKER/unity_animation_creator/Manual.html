<h3>Unity Animation Creator</h3>
A simple docker that assists with creating 2D animations to be used in Unity. Creates a new frame of the animation by adding a new group layer and paint layer. Then it sets the active node to the newly created paint layer for immediate painting.
<h3>Usage</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Make sure the docker is set into the UI by going to 'Settings' -> 'Docker' -> 'Unity Animation Creator'</li>
    <li>Place the Docker Window anywhere you wish</li>
    <li>When you are ready to create a new frame, press 'Create New Frame' in the docker.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Known Issues</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Opacity does not update immediately in the Krita Window. Until this is fixed or there is a workaround, all of the frames (except the new frame) will be invisible.</li>
</ul>
